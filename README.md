# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This is my first project utilizing JavaScript.  This was completed as part of The Odin Project, however, I decided to add additional features to personalize my project and to gain more experience.

Through my completion of this project I gained experience with JavaScript basics such as arrays, functions, the DOM, event listeners, conditional statements, switch statements, and more!

This project began by developing the basic logic to play a game of rock, paper, scissors (RPS) against the "computer".  Through the utilization of the DOM, I was able to construct a basic GUI that allows one to play a game of RPS without having to utilize the window.prompt() method and developer console.
